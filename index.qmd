Hey there,

What happens when I change this? Be sure to upload a professional headshot of yourself, and provide the appropriate links to your professional social media (linkedin, X/Twitter, etc). This is also a good place to provide a short summary of your education, career and interests. If you are associated with a lab or working with a research supervisor, it may be appropriate to provide some information on that here, along with links to relevant websites.
